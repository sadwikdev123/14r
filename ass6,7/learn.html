    <h1>Information for people who don't use Meta Products</h1>
    <p>Meta Platforms, Inc. ("Meta", "we", "our" or "us") processes your name, mobile phone number and/or your email address if we receive it from our users through the contact uploading or contact syncing feature available on Facebook, Messenger or Instagram ("contact uploading"). We process this information even if you are not a user of Facebook, Messenger or Instagram and/or don't have an account with us (a "non-user").</p>
    
    <h2>About contact uploading and how it works</h2>
    <p>When a user uses contact uploading and grants us access to their device's address book. We will access and upload the names, phone numbers and email addresses in their address book on a daily basis to our servers, including those of both users of Facebook, Messenger and/or Instagram and other contacts who are not users or don't have an account (i.e. non-users).
